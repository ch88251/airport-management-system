== Introduction

The purpose of this project is to develop a airport management system that showcases
the implementation of microservices architecture using Java, Quarkus, and Kubernetes.
The airport management system is designed to simulate a simplified version of a
real-world airport management system. It allows airport staff to manage airports, 
airlines, and flights.

== System Overview
The *Airport Management System* comprises several key modules and services to
manage airport operations, including airport-related data, runway details, 
terminal information, airline management, flight management and crew assignments. 
The system integrates these services to provide a centralized platform for managing
complex airport functions, all built using the Quarkus framework, with a PostgreSQL
database backend.

=== Key Components
1. *Airport Management*
   * *Purpose*: Manages overall airport-related data such as the airport's name, 
      location, IATA code, and facilities.
   * *Technology*: Java, Quarkus, JPA, PostgreSQL
   * *Description*: This component serves as the container for airport data and
      oversees the management of core attributes related to the physical airport
      infrastructure.
2. *Airline Management*
   * *Purpose*: Manages airlines and their fleets, including airline attributes 
      like name, country of origin, and fleet details.
   * *Technology*: Java, Quarkus, JPA, PostgreSQL
   * *Description*: This component serves as the container for airline data and
      ensures airlines and their fleets are managed efficiently within the system.
3. *Flight Management*
   * *Purpose*: Manages flight-related operations, including flight schedules, 
      statuses, and assignments.
   * *Technology*: Java, Quarkus, JPA, PostgreSQL
   * *Description*: The flight management component oversees the scheduling of
      flights and the tracking of their statuses, ensuring that flight information
      is always up-to-date.
